# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles that are presented at the beginning of each day of the Advent calendar. Every year, two puzzles are presented on each day, starting on December 1 and ending on December 25. The puzzles increase in difficulty as the days go by. The ones toward the end become quite challenging. The solution to all puzzles involves writing code in the programming language of choice.

I am sharing my personal solutions on GitHub for future reference and for anyone who might be interested.
